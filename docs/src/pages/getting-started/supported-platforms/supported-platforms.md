# Supported Platforms

<p class="description">Learn about the platforms, from modern to old, that are supported by React-Material.</p>

## Browser

React-Material supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.
We also support Internet Explorer 11.
You don't need to provide any JavaScript polyfill as we manage unsupported browser features internally and in isolation.

| IE    | Edge   | Firefox | Chrome | Safari |
|:------|:-------|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| 11    | >= 14  | >= 45   | >= 49  | >= 10  |

## Server

Because React-Material supports server side rendering, we need to support the latest, stable releases of [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node).
We try to support the [last active LTS version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#lts-schedule1). Right now, we support **node v6.x** and newer versions.
