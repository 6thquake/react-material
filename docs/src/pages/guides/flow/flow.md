# Flow

You can add static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality thanks to [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow).
Have a look at the [Create React App with Flow](https://github.com/6thquake/react-material/tree/develop/examples/create-react-app-with-flow) example.

## flow-typed

The community is maintaining the definitions under this project.
