# Mui-Org Governance

## Overview

Mui-Org houses projects related to [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/), a set of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components
that implement [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html)
specification. Our mission is to create a customizable Material Design implementation
for anyone to use. We value an open, collaborative, and diverse community where anyone can join in
discussions, learn from one another, and contribute to the project. This document describes how
we govern ourselves, how decisions are made, and how someone could engage with the project.

## Roles & Responsibilities

can be a user and we encourage users to participate in the community as much as possible in the
following ways.

[following us on twitter](https://twitter.com/i/notifications), or just talking about us with your
friends.

Contributors are members of the community who contribute to Material-UI or one of Mui-Org's projects
in concrete ways. Anyone can be a contributor. In addition to their participation as a user, they

### Committers

Committers are members of the community who are committed to the development, success, and mission
of Material-UI or one of Mui-Org's projects. New committers are nominated and voted on by existing
committers. Under rare circumstances, the Core Team can vote to revoke a committer's privilege. In
addition to their participation as a contributor, committers have the following privileges.
- Access to a private Gitter room to talk about issues and coordinate development.
- Ability to label, close, and manage [Github issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues).

### Core Team

Core Team members are individuals that are invested in the success of Mui-Org. Their
administrative responsibilities ensure the sustainability and smooth running of Mui-Org. New
Core Team members are nominated and voted on by existing committers. Under rare circumstances, a
Core Team member can be removed by a two thirds majority vote by the Core Team. Two people
from the same company cannot exist on the Core Team.

At the end of each quarter, the Core Team may issue payments to one or more committers. The amount
issued will be determined by a formula that's transparent to all committers and voted on by the
Core Team. The formula can change at the end of the quarter, but not mid-quarter unless unanimously
agreed upon by the Core Team and all committers with whom any payment may be owed. These payments
are aimed to [increase the sustainability of our organization](https://medium.com/call-em-all/material-ui-the-move-to-a-sustainable-open-source-project-5261d07b5067) by supporting committers.
