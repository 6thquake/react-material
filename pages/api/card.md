Any other properties supplied will be [spread to the root element](/guides/api#spread).

## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by React-Material thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes) section
and the [implementation of the component](https://github.com/6thquake/react-material/tree/develop/packages/react-material/src/Card/Card.js)
for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiCard`.

## Inheritance

The properties of the [Paper](/api/paper) component are also available.
