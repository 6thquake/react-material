## Supporting React-Material

React-Material is an MIT-licensed open source project. It's an independent project with ongoing development made possible thanks to the support of these awesome [backers](/BACKERS.md).

Your contributions, donations, and sponsorship allow us to build a sustainable organization. They directly support office hours, continued enhancements, great documentation and learning materials!


## Usage (v1-beta)

Here is a quick example to get you started, **it's all you need**:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { renderÂ } from 'react-dom';
import Button from 'react-material/Button';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button variant="raised" color="primary">
      Hello World
    </Button>
  );
}

render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'));
```

## Should I start with v1-beta?
We often get this question:

> Should I start with v1-beta? Beta is beta, so it's not a final product and I'm not guaranteed anything.

**Yes, you should.**

Some users are starting projects with v0.x which given the quality and stability of v1 they shouldn't be. They are just creating extra work for themselves as they will have to transition at some point.

The v1-beta effort started in May 2016, and it resolves many of the issues with v0. Many of us are already using v1-beta in production with no problems, and resolving the occasional breaking change is less hassle than upgrading from v0.x to v1 would be.

React-Material will never be a final product, you will never be guaranteed anything whether with v0.x, v1, or any future release.
We are keeping v1 in beta so we can release breaking changes without having them slow us down.

[The release notes](https://github.com/6thquake/react-material/tags) always describe the breaking changes introduced with each release.

**Bite the bullet and go for v1-beta.**
