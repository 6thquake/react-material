# Snackbars

[Snackbars](https://material.io/guidelines/components/snackbars-toasts.html) provide brief feedback about an operation through a message - typically at the bottom of the screen.

Snackbars contain a single line of text directly related to the operation performed.
They may contain a text action, but no icons.

Only one snackbar may be displayed at a time.

## Simple

A basic snackbar that aims to reproduce Google Keep's snackbar behavior.

### Consecutive Snackbars

Per [Google's guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/components/snackbars-toasts.html#snackbars-toasts-usage), when a second snackbar is triggered while the first is displayed, the first should start the contraction motion downwards before the second one animates upwards.
