# ExpansionPanelActions



## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| <span class="prop-name required">children *</span> | <span class="prop-type">node |  | The content of the component. |
| <span class="prop-name">classes</span> | <span class="prop-type">object |  | Useful to extend the style applied to components. |

Any other properties supplied will be [spread to the root element](/guides/api#spread).

## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by React-Material thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `action`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes) section
and the [implementation of the component](http://git.dev.sh.ctripcorp.com/sixthquake/react-material/tree/develop/packages/material-ui/src/ExpansionPanel/ExpansionPanelActions.js)
for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiExpansionPanelActions`.
