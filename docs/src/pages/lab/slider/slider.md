# Slider

<p class="description">Sliders allow users to make selections from a range of values.</p>

[Sliders](https://material.io/guidelines/components/sliders.html) reflect a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value. They are ideal for adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, or applying image filters.

Sliders can have icons on both ends of the bar that reflect a range of values.

#### Immediate effects

Changes made with sliders are immediate, allowing a user to make slider adjustments until finding their preference. They shouldnâ€™t be paired with settings that have even minor delays in providing user feedback.

#### Current state

Sliders reflect the current state of the settings they control.
