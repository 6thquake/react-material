Help support Material-UI!

Material-UI is an MIT-licensed open source project. It's an independent project with ongoing development made possible thanks to the support of these awesome [backers](https://material-ui.com/discover-more/backers/).

---

As a group of volunteers you can help us in a few ways

- Giving developer time on the project. (Message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaterialUI) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/mui-org/material-ui) for guidance).
Companies should be paying their employees to contribute back to the open source projects they use everyday.
- Giving funds by becoming one of our sponsors/donators!

If you'd like to sustain the future of the project as a whole, we have an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/material-ui) that you can donate to.
This is a way for funds to be allocated to the core team.

You can also support [Olivier](https://github.com/oliviertassinari) a this [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/oliviertassinari).
