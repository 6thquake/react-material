# Anchor

[Dividers](https://material.io/guidelines/components/dividers.html) group and separate content within lists and page layouts. The divider is a thin rule, lightweight yet sufficient to distinguish content visually and spatially.

## List Dividers

The divider renders as a `<hr>` by default.
You can save rendering this DOM element by using the `divider` property on the `ListItem` component.
