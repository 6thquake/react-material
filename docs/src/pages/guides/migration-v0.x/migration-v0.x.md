# Migration From v0.x

## FAQ

### Woah - the API is way different! Does that mean 1.0 is completely different, Iâ€™ll have to learn the basics all over again, and migrating will be practically impossible?

Iâ€™m glad you asked! The answer is no. The core concepts havenâ€™t changed.
You will notice that the API provides more flexibility, but this has a cost.
We have been making lower-level components, abstracting less complexity.

### What motivated such large change?

React-Material was started at 2018.
The ecosystem has evolved a lot since then, we have also learned a lot.
[@nathanmarks](https://github.com/nathanmarks/) started an ambitious task, rebuilding React-Material from the **ground-up**
taking advantage of this knowledge to address long-standing issues. To name some of the major changes:
- New styling solution using CSS-in-JS (better [customization](/customization/overrides) power, better performance)
- New [theme handling](/customization/themes) (nesting, self-supporting, etc.)
- Blazing fast documentation thanks to [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)
- Way better [test coverage](/guides/testing) (99%+, run on all the major browsers, [visual regression tests])
- Full [server-side rendering](/guides/server-rendering) support
- Wide range of [supported browsers](/getting-started/supported-platforms)

### Where should I start in a migration?

1. Start by installing the v1.x version of React-Material along side the v0.x version.
   [**Yarn**](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) provides an alias feature to do so:

  ```sh
  yarn add react-material@latest
  yarn add @6thquake/react-material@next
  ```

  then

  ```js
  import FlatButton from 'react-material/FlatButton'; // v0.1.x
  import Button from '@6thquake/react-material/Button'; // v0.2.x
  ```

  If you can't use Yarn, we also provide a separate package for **NPM**.
  However, the package might not be always up to date.
  **It's why we encourage you to use a Yarn alias**.

  ```sh
  npm install react-material@latest
  npm install @6thquake/react-material@next
  ```

  then

  ```js
  import FlatButton from 'react-material/FlatButton'; // v0.x
  import Button from '@6thquake/react-material/Button'; // v1.x
  ```
