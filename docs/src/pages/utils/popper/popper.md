# Popper

<p class="description">A Popper can be used to display some content on top of another. It's an alternative to react-popper.</p>

Things to know when using the `Popper` component:

- Poppers rely on the 3rd party library [Popper.js](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js) for positioning.
- The children is [`Portal`](/utils/portal) to the body of the document to avoid rendering problems.
You can disable this behavior with `disablePortal`.
- The scroll and click away aren't blocked like with the [`Popover`](/utils/popover) component.
The placement of the popper updates with the available area in the viewport.
- The `anchorEl` is passed as the reference object to create a new `Popper.js` instance.

## Without transition Popper

## Faked reference object

The `anchorEl` property can be a reference to a fake DOM element.
You just need to create an object shaped like the [`ReferenceObject`](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/blob/0642ce0ddeffe3c7c033a412d4d60ce7ec8193c3/packages/popper/index.d.ts#L118-L123).

Highlight part of the text to see the popper:

## Render Props

It is a [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) demo that
keeps track of the local state for a single popper.
