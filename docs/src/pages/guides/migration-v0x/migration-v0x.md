# Migration From v0.x

<p class="description">Yeah, v1 has been released! Take advantage of 2 years worth of effort.</p>

## FAQ

### Woah - the API is way different! Does that mean 1.0 is completely different, Iâ€™ll have to learn the basics all over again, and migrating will be practically impossible?

Iâ€™m glad you asked! The answer is no. The core concepts havenâ€™t changed.
You will notice that the API provides more flexibility, but this has a cost.
We have been making lower-level components, abstracting less complexity.

### What motivated such a large change?

React-Material was started [4 years ago](https://github.com/6thquake/react-material/commit/28b768913b75752ecf9b6bb32766e27c241dbc46).
The ecosystem has evolved a lot since then, we have also learned a lot.
[@nathanmarks](https://github.com/nathanmarks/) started an ambitious task, rebuilding React-Material from the **ground-up**
taking advantage of this knowledge to address long-standing issues. To name some of the major changes:
- New styling solution using CSS-in-JS (better [customization](/customization/overrides) power, better performance)
- New [theme handling](/customization/themes) (nesting, self-supporting, etc.)
- Blazing fast documentation thanks to [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)
- Way better [test coverage](/guides/testing) (99%+, run on all the major browsers, [visual regression tests](https://www.argos-ci.com/mui-org/material-ui))
- Full [server-side rendering](/guides/server-rendering) support
- Wide range of [supported browsers](/getting-started/supported-platforms)

### Where should I start in a migration?

1. Start by installing the v1.x version of React-Material along side the v0.x version.

  With yarn:
  ```sh
  yarn add material-ui
  yarn add @6thquake/react-material
  ```

  Or with npm:
  ```sh
  npm install material-ui
  npm install @6thquake/react-material
  ```

  then

  ```js
  import FlatButton from 'material-ui/FlatButton'; // v0.x
  import Button from '@6thquake/react-material/Button'; // v1.x
  ```

2. Run [the migration helper](https://github.com/6thquake/react-material/tree/master/packages/material-ui-codemod) on your project.
3. `MuiThemeProvider` is optional for v1.x., but if you have a custom theme, you are free to use v0.x and v1.x versions of the component at the same time, like this:

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { MuiThemeProvider, createMuiTheme } from '@6thquake/react-material/styles'; // v1.x
  import { MuiThemeProvider as V0MuiThemeProvider} from 'material-ui';
  import getMuiTheme from 'material-ui/styles/getMuiTheme';

  const theme = createMuiTheme({
    /* theme for v1.x */
  });
  const themeV0 = getMuiTheme({
    /* theme for v0.x */
  });

  function App() {
    return (
      <MuiThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <V0MuiThemeProvider muiTheme={themeV0}>
          {/*Components*/}
        </V0MuiThemeProvider>
      </MuiThemeProvider>
    );
  }

  export default App;
  ```

4. After that, you are free to migrate one component instance at the time.

## Components

### Autocomplete

React-Material doesn't provide a high-level API for solving this problem.
You're encouraged you to explore [the solutions the React community has built](/demos/autocomplete/).

In the future, we will look into providing a simple component to solve the simple use cases: [#9997](https://github.com/6thquake/react-material/issues/9997).

### Svg Icon

Run [the migration helper](https://github.com/6thquake/react-material/tree/master/packages/material-ui-codemod) on your project.

This will apply a change such as the following:

```diff
-import AddIcon from 'material-ui/svg-icons/Add';
+import AddIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Add';

<AddIcon />
```

### Flat Button

```diff
-import FlatButton from 'material-ui/FlatButton';

```diff
-import Subheader from 'material-ui/Subheader';
+import ListSubheader from '@6thquake/react-material/ListSubheader';

-<Subheader>Sub Heading</Subheader>

```

### Toggle

```diff
-import Toggle from 'material-ui/Toggle';
+import Switch from '@6thquake/react-material/Switch';

-<Toggle
-  toggled={this.state.checkedA}

-/>
+<Switch
+  checked={this.state.checkedA}
