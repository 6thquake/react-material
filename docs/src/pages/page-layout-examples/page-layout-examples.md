# Page layout examples

<p class="description">A selection of basic page layouts to help you get started building your app.</p>

They can be combined with one of the [example applications](https://github.com/6thquake/react-material/tree/master/examples) to form a complete starter.

Sections of each layout are clearly defined either by comments or use of separate files, 
making it simple to extract parts of a page (such as a "hero unit", or footer, for example) 
for reuse in other pages.

For multi-part examples, a table in the README at the linked source code location describes 
the purpose of each file. 

{{"demo": "pages/page-layout-examples/PageLayoutExamples.js", "hideHeader": true}}

If while using these examples you make changes or enhancements that could improve the 
developer experience, or you would like to contrbute an additional example,
please consider creating a [pull-request on GitHub](https://github.com/6thquake/react-material/pulls).
