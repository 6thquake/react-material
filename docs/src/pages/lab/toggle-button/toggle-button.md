# Toggle Buttons

<p class="description">Toggle buttons can be used to group related options.</p>

To emphasize groups of related [Toggle buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#toggle-button),
a group should share a common container.

The `ToggleButtonGroup` will control the selected of its child buttons when
given its own `value` prop.
