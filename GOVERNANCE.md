# 6thquake Governance

## Overview

6thquake houses projects related to [React-Material](http://git.dev.sh.ctripcorp.com/sixthquake/react-material), a set of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components
that implement [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html)
specification. Our mission is to create a customizable Material Design implementation
for anyone to use. We value an open, collaborative, and diverse community where anyone can join in
discussions, learn from one another, and contribute to the project. This document describes how
we govern ourselves, how decisions are made, and how someone could engage with the project.
