# Dividers

[Dividers](https://material.io/guidelines/components/dividers.html) group and separate content within lists and page layouts. The divider is a thin rule, lightweight yet sufficient to distinguish content visually and spatially.

## List Dividers

The divider renders as a `<hr>` by default.
You can save rendering this DOM element by using the `divider` property on the `ListItem` component.

## Inset Dividers

The following example demonstrates the `inset` property.
We need to make sure the `Divider` is rendered as a `li` to match the HTML5 specification.
The example shows two ways of achieving this.
